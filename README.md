### Welcome to my profile! ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I'm Lucas, a technology enthusiast in its purest form. I have a passion for understanding how computers work, both in terms of hardware and software. Here you will find a variety of projects, from tinkering with data bits on a breadboard to complex front-end projects for mobile devices. My goal is to cover a wide range of topics, exploring cutting-edge technology.

I have a special interest in applying artificial intelligence to chatbots and robotics ðŸ¤– I love exploring new possibilities in this field and I'm constantly studying and learning new things.

Feel free to explore my projects and discover how technology can be fascinating and inspiring. If you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to have a chat about technology, don't hesitate to get in touch.
